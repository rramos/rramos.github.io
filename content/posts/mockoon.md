In this article we will go though Mockoon, understand its features how to setup and how to use on your Development stage

## Intro ##

Mockoon is a free cross-platform desktop application that takes API mocking to the next level. Mockoon offers a fast and easy-to-use interface and gives you complete control over your mock APIs with advanced functionality like a templating system, a proxy mode, and request recording.

## Install ##

I will be using the Arch distribution package

```sh
pacman -S mockoon-bin
```

If you start the `mockoon` application you will get something like this

## Create Environment ##

Lets start by creating a new **Local Environment** and select a json datafile to store the data.

> Note: You can synchronize your setup in Mockoon Cloud and collaborate with other coworkers by subscribing the service.

When you create a new environment a default `/GET` endpoint is create, if you push **Start Server** if will be available. 

## Create New Endpoint ##

Create a new HTTP Endpoint with the path `/users` and set the following body

```json
// Sample body
[
  {{#repeat 10}}
    {
      "id": "{{faker 'string.uuid'}}",
      "name": "{{faker 'person.firstName'}} {{faker 'person.lastName'}}",
      "email": "{{faker 'internet.email'}}",
      "phone": "{{faker 'phone.number'}}",
      "address": "{{faker 'location.streetAddress'}}, {{faker 'location.city'}}, {{faker 'location.state' abbreviated=true}} {{faker 'location.zipCode'}}",
      "birthdate": "{{faker 'date.past'}}",
      "isActive": {{faker 'datatype.boolean'}}
    }
  {{/repeat}}
]
```

And finally lets add a Header **Content-Type** with `application/json` so that the client understand the response format.

If you start the server now and access the endpoint you will check some interesting Mockdata available.

## Add delay to response ##

Now lets add **delay to response** to simulate a real-world scenario where the server takes some time to process the request. (This is useful for testing client's behavior when the server is slow to respond)

* Lets include **2000 milliseconds** (2 seconds) on the response

## Settings ##

* If you choose Settings you can change the default port of the Environment, TLS configuration and Latency

## Logs ##

* The Logs section allow you to check all the `requests` and `responses` for this tool

## CORS ##

* You can add CORS headers to the environment like the following example

```txt
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE,HEAD,OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Origin, Accept,Authorization,Content-Length, X-Requested-With
```

## Request body formats ##

Mockoon supports the following request body formats

* `application/json`
* `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
* `multipart/form-data`
* `application/xml`

Example `json` body helper

```json
{{body 'key'}}
<!-- object-path syntax -->
{{body 'nested.key'}}
<!-- JSONPath syntax -->
{{body '$.nested.key'}}
```

## Import/export in OpenAPI format ##

* Mockoon supports imports in both OpenAPI v2 (Swagger) and v3 formats. Environments can be exported to OpenAPI version 3 as JSON file.

## CRUD - Data bucket link ##

* After creating a **CRUD endpoint**, you need to link it to a data bucket. A data bucket is a key value store where you can create reusable content or data for your routes.
* The data buckets are defined at the environment level and are generated when the server starts. It means that their state persists between each call

### Create a data bucket ###

* To create a new data bucket, open the **Data** options by clicking on the tab at the top of the window and add a new data bucket by clicking on the "plus" button:

## Mock sample ##

* If you would like to test some existing API, you could double-check the [mock-samples](https://mockoon.com/mock-samples/category/all) to understand if there is one available already.

## JWT Helper ##

* Mockoon templating system includes various helpers to help you create dynamic responses. This [page](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/jwt-helpers) lists the helpers related to JWT tokens.

## Mockoon Serverless ##

* Mockoon's Serverless package provides an easy way to run Mockoon's mock APIs in cloud functions and serverless environments: AWS Lambda, GCP Functions, Firebase Functions, etc

### Serverless Installation ###

```sh
npm install @mockoon/serverless
```
### Firebase Example ###

To use Mockoon Serverless in a Firebase Function, you can use the following code

```javascript
const { onRequest } = require('firebase-functions/v2/https');
const mockoon = require('@mockoon/serverless');

// Load the Mockoon Environment object
const mockEnv = require('./datafile.json');

const app = new mockoon.MockoonServerless(mockEnv).firebaseApp();

exports.app = onRequest(app);
```

## Conclusion ##

In this article, we explored the basic functionality of Mockoon and demonstrated how mocking APIs with Mockoon can accelerate application development, integration, testing, and demos. By providing a stable and consistent environment, Mockoon significantly enhances the developer onboarding process, speeds up the development lifecycle, and reduces dependencies between frontend and backend teams.

With API mocking, you can start working with third-party APIs almost immediately, without needing to register for an account. It also offers the flexibility required to run complex integration tests for interconnected systems, microservices, or third-party API integrations.

This article only scratched the surface of this toolâ€™s potential, but I highly recommend it to any backend or frontend developer.
