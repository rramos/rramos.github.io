Article where I share the Manager Playbook template

## Intro ##

When managing a Software Engineering team, there are several activities one normally conducts such as People Management, Roadmap Planning and execution, Defining OKRs, Individual objects, Defining the Communication strategy, and the list continues.

I normally create my own **Manager Playbook** in order to keep track of those activities and include new ones.

This helps on making sure one is conducting the activities as expected and to have a centralized place where to store those actions.

The following document can serve as template in case your are starting this type of activities.

Feel free to reach me out in order to include something that you think it makes sense.

Just make a copy and start registering :)
