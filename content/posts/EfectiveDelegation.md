Article about Effective Delegation

## Intro ##

Effective delegation involves assigning tasks and responsibilities to other people in order to achieve a goal. It is a key skill for any manager or leader, as it allows them to manage their workload more efficiently and effectively. Effective delegation requires the manager to clearly communicate the task, provide support and guidance, and monitor progress. It also requires the manager to trust the person they are delegating to and to provide them with the necessary resources and authority to complete the task.

## 5 Steps for Effective Delegation ##

1. **Specify Outcome** - Be clear and specific with the desired result, begin with end in mind and describe goals not actions. Also ask how they have understood the desired result. Set a clear timeline and include deadlines.
1. **Guidelines** - Establish controls and limits to the work, identify boundaries and constraints. Organizational or financial limitations. What responsibilities and authorities should the person take into account.
1. **Resources** - What support can the person expect from you or other people. Provide sufficient support but resist upward delegation. Request for recommended solutions. Also share available resources such as courses, books, machines or software to accomplish the task.
1. **Evaluation / Monitoring** - Agree on a schedule of checkpoints, keep up to date with progress. Focus on results not procedures
1. **Feedback / Recognition** - When the work is done, give recognition where it is deserved. Very important point for future motivation and productive behavior

There isn't a one style fits all, and the it should be chose based on the competence level of the person for that specific task.

## Delegation Styles ##

Delegation styles vary depending on the manager's approach and the situation.

### Autocratic ###

The autocratic style of delegation is characterized by the manager making all decisions and giving orders without any input from the team. This style is often used in emergency situations or when the manager has a great deal of experience and knowledge in the area.

### Directive ###

The directive style of delegation involves the manager providing clear instructions and guidance to the team. The manager is still in control but allows the team to use their own initiative and make decisions within the framework provided.

### Consultative ###

The consultative style of delegation involves the manager consulting with the team before making decisions. The team is given the opportunity to provide input and the manager takes their views into account when making decisions.
