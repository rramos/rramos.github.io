CAMPS Model presents the 5 factors for great 1-on-1s

## Intro ##

The 5 factors of great 1-on-1s.

* **Certainty**: The conversation in the 1-on-1 increased certainty - clarity of goals, success metrics, roles, and plans.
* **Autonomy**: The conversation in the 1-on-1 helped you feel more ownership, the ability to make choices, and have a ‘voice’.
* **Meaning**: The conversation in the 1-on-1 helped increase your feeling of meaning, knowing the why behind your tasks.
* **Progress**: The conversation in the 1-on-1 helped you learn, unblock your progress, and develop your skills and strengths.
* **Social inclusion**: The conversation in the 1-on-1 led to greater bonding, fun, and feelings of inclusion.

Together, these 5 factors make up what LifeLabs Learning calls CAMPS. 
You can use CAMPS as a model to know what to add to your 1-on-1s.
