Article about Porto Tech HUB

## Intro ##

I've attend today to the second edition of Porto Tech HUB 2016. It was good to see old friends and the raising tech potential in the City.

There where some good presentations, good organization and the location was appealing also.

I especially liked Christoffer Noring presentation about [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) and [Angular](https://angularjs.org) and Miguel Veiga about [Storm](http://storm.apache.org) and [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org).

This last one have more to do with my actual work.
