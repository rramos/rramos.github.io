## Intro

Interesting research article that accessed the cognitive impact of the usage of LLMs

## Article

* <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563224002541>

## Highlights

* LLM users reported a lower cognitive load than traditional search engine users.
* Students using LLMs showed weaker reasoning in their analyses.
* No significant difference in perspective diversity between LLM and search engine groups.
* Findings suggest LLMs reduce cognitive load but may limit depth of content engagement.

## Conclusion

Conclusion of this research

> In conclusion, while LLMs like ChatGPT offer an efficient way to reduce intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load, they may not always facilitate the deep learning necessary for complex decision-making tasks. Traditional search engines, by necessitating more active engagement, may promote a higher quality of learning, underscoring the need for educational practices that encourage critical engagement with diverse information sources.

I also recommend the reference video from  Joe Rogan podcast with Bernie Sanders where they discuss critical issues like wealth inequality, healthcare challenges, and the societal impact of technology and automation, emphasizing the need for systemic change and meaningful purpose in people's lives.

All good points to reflect on what would be the meaning of accomplishment in future sociaties and impact of LLMs in that path
