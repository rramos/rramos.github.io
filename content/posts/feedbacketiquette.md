In this article I gather the key principals for requesting and providing Feedback

## Intro ##

This [article](https://leaddev.com/process/comments-etiquette-requesting-and-giving-feedback) by *Cara Marin* provides a concise yet insightful summary on comments and feedback etiquette in distributed work environments. It offers valuable hints on how to enhance collaboration through effective commenting practices. I highly recommend reading it for practical tips and best practices.

## Summary ##

In the context of distributed work, effective comments and feedback are crucial for collaboration among software engineers. Poor comments etiquette can hinder collaboration and complicate decision-making.

## Key Principals ##

Key Principles for Good Comments Etiquette:

* **Listen Fully and Presently**: Engage completely with the document before commenting.
* **Confirm Alignment and Understanding**: Ensure mutual understanding before responding.
* **Collect Your Thoughts**: Think before providing feedback.
* **Provide Actionable Feedback**: Comments should be constructive and practical.
* **Agree on Next Steps**: Ensure clear next steps are outlined.

## Importance of Comments Etiquette ##

Repetitive tasks, like reviewing documents, can lead to habits that undermine effective feedback, such as jumping to conclusions or making hasty comments.

## How to Get High-Quality Feedback ##

* **Specify the Feedback Needed**: Be clear whether you need strategic, directional, or final-stage proofreading feedback.
* **Guide Reviewers**: Direct attention to specific parts of the document needing feedback.

## Best Practices for Commenting ##

### Direct Quotes and Highlighting ###

Use quotes or highlight text effectively to make comments clear.

### Appropriate Use of Comments ###

Know when to use comments and when to opt for a direct conversation, especially for sensitive or complex feedback.

> A general rule is: If you need more than three comments back and forth to discuss, you should probably move to a face-to-face conversation, like a Slack huddle or Zoom call. Make sure you circle back on the initial thread and document a summary of what was discussed during that call for future reviewers

### Notify Colleagues ###

Inform teammates when feedback is provided to avoid confusion and ensure timely responses.

## Conclusion ##

Adopting and maintaining good comments etiquette is essential for effective collaboration in distributed teams. Leading by example can promote better feedback practices within an organization.
