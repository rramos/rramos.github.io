Article about docker using btrfs filesystem

## Intro ##

So dockers tend to start growing like weeds. And cost me space i don't have. But one could change the storage driver. You could choose LVM and take advantage of the snapshots or btrfs which i already have.

## Btrfs ##

Btrfs is a next generation copy-on-write filesystem that supports many advanced storage technologies that make it a good fit for Docker. Btrfs is included in the mainline Linux kernel.

Dockerâ€™s btrfs storage driver leverages many Btrfs features for image and container management. Among these features are block-level operations, thin provisioning, copy-on-write snapshots, and ease of administration. You can easily combine multiple physical block devices into a single Btrfs filesystem.

## Requirements ##

* Install btrfs
* Make sure you have a volume formatted as btrfs (not part of the article)

## Clean all dockers and images ##

```bash
# Delete all containers
sudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -a -q)
# Delete all images
sudo docker rmi $(sudo docker images -q)
```

## Setup ##

Make sure you have btrfs on your system

```bash
sudo cat /proc/filesystems | grep btrfs
```

1. Stop docker

```bash
sudo service docker stop
```

1. Create a backup of you docker settings

```bash
sudo mv /var/lib/docker/ /var/lib/docker.bak
```

1. create a subvolume from an existing btrfs FS

```bash
btrfs subvolume create /archive/dockers
```

**NOTE:** It's better to use a dedicate disk for it

1. Create the symlink

```bash
ln -s /archive/dockers /var/lib/docker
```

1. Copy the backup data to the new location

```bash
cp -rp /var/lib/docker.bak/* /var/lib/docker/
```

1. Configure Docker to use the btrfs storage driver. This is required even though `/var/lib/docker/` is now using a Btrfs filesystem. Edit or create the file `/etc/docker/daemon.json`.

```json
{
  "storage-driver": "btrfs"
}
```

1. Start docker service

```bash
sudo service docker start
```

1. Check if docker is running with docker support

```bash
sudo docker info|grep  "Storage Driver"
```

You could check the volumes being created with the command

```bash
sudo btrfs subvolume list /var/liv/docker |grep dockers
```
