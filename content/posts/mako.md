## Excerpt

Mako is an extremely fast, production-grade web bundler based on Rust.

## Intro

- Extremely fast, Mako is built in Rust, which is known for its performance and safety. Mako takes advantage of data-parallelism and caching features to provide fast and efficient bundling.

- Production-grade, Mako is already in production use in hundreds of projects at Ant Group. And we have tested it in thousands of projects and it has proven to be reliable and stable.

- Easy to use, Mako is designed to be easy to use out of the box. Start with zero configuration and customize it as needed. Mako is also compatible with existing frameworks like Umi.

## Getting Started

Install via npm bundled with react

```sh
npm create mako
```

Install and run

```sh
cd mako-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`

## Disclaimer

I’m not an expert on frontend stacks, so I can’t definitively recommend this bundler. However, the benchmark results are quite impressive. That said, you might face challenges with the documentation, as much of the development is primarily supported by Chinese developers.
