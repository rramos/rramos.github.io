Article about keyboard layouts configuration in Linux

## Intro ##

Reminder article for as I'm constantly forgetting the keyboard layout in my Linux distribution.
This started mostly after I have decided to use a 65% keyboard which misses a lot of keys from a traditional 100%.

Still it has other advantages less space used and linear switches which allow faster input. Being a US traditional Layout there are some portuguese characters missing and having a 65% keyboard doesn't help either. Nevertheless after some weeks of adjustment improvements are noticed.

The best layout to choose in Linux would be `English (intl, with AltGr dead keys)` for this setup.

I still think that the english layout is the best option to follow. In regards to size a 85% seems a better options specially if you need to deal with spreadsheets.
