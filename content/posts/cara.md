Article about CARA a social media and portfolio platform for artists

## About ##

[Cara](https://cara.app/) is a social media and portfolio platform for artists.

With the widespread use of generative AI, we decided to build a place that filters out generative AI images so that people who want to find authentic creatives and artwork can do so easily.

Many platforms currently accept AI art when it’s not ethical, while others have promised “no AI forever” policies without consideration for the scenario where adoption of such technologies may happen at the workplace in the coming years.

The future of creative industries requires nuanced understanding and support to help artists and companies connect and work together. We want to bridge the gap and build a platform that we would enjoy using as creatives ourselves.

## How it works ##

Cara partnership with the Glaze Project. Glaze is a tool designed to protect artists from style mimicry by generative AI models.

## Glaze Project ##

The Glaze Project (including Glaze, Nightshade, WebGlaze and others) is a research effort that develops technical tools with the explicit goal of protecting human creatives against invasive uses of generative artificial intelligence or GenAI. Our team is composed of computer science professors and PhD students from the University of Chicago. We perform research studies and develop tools that artists can use to disrupt unauthorized AI training on their work product. Ultimately, our goal is to ensure the continued vitality of human artists, and to restore balance and ensure a healthy coexistence between AI and human creatives, where the human creatives retain agency and control over their work products and their use.

## Conclusion ##

It's fascinating how groups of creators are collaborating to counter the overwhelming presence of generative AI, which some platforms exploit solely for profit. I believe this kind of collective action will become more prevalent in our society to safeguard human creativity, allowing AI to handle the monotonous and repetitive tasks we endure. This movement could also create new business opportunities, as there is evident demand for AI-free content. However, a significant challenge lies in developing tools for proper identification of such content, at least until a legal framework is established to protect creators.
