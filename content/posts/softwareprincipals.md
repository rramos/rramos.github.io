In this article we are going to explore some Software Engineering Principals

## Intro ##

When developing software it is important not to forget some important principals

### Modularity ###

Break complex software into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

### Abstraction ###

Hide the implementation details of a module or component behind an interface or API, so that users of that component only need to know how to interact with it, not how it works.

### Separation of Concerns ###

Organize software into separate layers, modules, or components, each with a specific responsibility or concern, to minimize dependencies and improve maintainability.

### Encapsulation ###

Limit the visibility of data and functions to only the parts of the software that need to interact with them, to prevent unintended interference and improve maintainability.

### Single Responsibility Principle ###

Ensure that each module or component has only one responsibility, so that changes to one aspect of the software do not affect unrelated parts.

### Open/Closed Principle ###

Design modules and components so that they are open for extension (i.e., new functionality can be added) but closed for modification (i.e., existing functionality does not need to be changed).

### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) ###

Eliminate duplication of code or logic within a software system, to improve maintainability and reduce the risk of errors.

### Test-Driven Development ###

Write automated tests before writing code, to ensure that the code is correct and to improve maintainability.

### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) ###

Automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software, to reduce the risk of errors and to improve efficiency.

### Code Reviews ###

Have other developers review code changes before they are merged into the main codebase, to catch errors and improve maintainability.

> Think on ways to incorporate this principals not only on the design phase but also on your daily development activities.
