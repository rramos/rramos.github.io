New theme

## Intro ##

This blog is implemented using Hexo, and the actual theme used does not provide a good interface for local searches as it relies on Google search, but there are several alternative themes with that functionality.

As such I've decided to upgrade to a different theme based on LEEDOM:

* <https://github.com/leedom92/hexo-theme-leedom>

For this theme also included the following modules:

* **hexo-generator-feed**
* **hexo-generator-search**

Which means now I have out-of-the box RSS feeds and local search

After some minor customizations the new layout is online.

I've also taken the time to upgrade the npm packages.

Looking clean :D
