This article is about the Book - The One Thing

## Intro ##

One of the references that I most enjoyed on the book:

* **The One Thing**, by *Gary Keller, Jay Papasan*

Passion for something leads to disproportionate time practicing or working at it. That time spent eventually translates to skill, and when skill improves, results improve. Better results generally lead to more enjoyment, and more passion and more time is invested. It can be a virtuous cycle all the way to extraordinary results

> Find something you love, put your energy on it and good things will come out of it

Many people struggle to achieve their goals because they lack clear direction and focus. Our One Thing Approach provides a clear path to success.
