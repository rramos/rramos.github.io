Article with general interview questions

## Intro ##

I saw this article with a very interesting consolidation of questions a candidate should ask when trying to find it's ideal job.

This list is very useful independently on the side of the chair you are on:

## About the Job ##

* What are the biggest challenges I might face in this position ?
* Why did the current person in this position leave ?
* How do you expect my responsibilities to involve as time goes on ?
* How will I be measured for success ?

## About the Company ##

* What are the current goals of the Company ?
* How would you describe the company's values ?
* How have the company's values evolved in the time you' ve worked there ?
* What is the company's approach to professional development and growth ?

## About the Culture ##

* How does this company invest in employee well-being ?
* Are there any efforts or initiatives in place to ensure diversity and inclusion in this company ?
* What is the general sentiment of culture in the company, according to current employees ?
* How does management react in situations that may result in low company morale ?
