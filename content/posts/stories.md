This article provides some good practices to write scrum stories

## Components ##

When writing user stories, you will need to include the following components:

* **User persona.** What is your user like? What is their relation to the project? What goals do they have?

* **Definition of Done.** This refers to an agreed upon set of items that must be completed before a user story can be considered complete.

* **Tasks.** What are the key activities needed to complete the user story?

* **Any feedback already provided.** If you are adding features to an existing product and you have already received feedback from customers on a past iteration, make sure to consider this feedback.  

## I.N.V.E.S.T ##

Your user stories should meet the I.N.V.E.S.T. criteria:

* **Independent:** The storyâ€™s completion is not dependent on another story.

* **Negotiable:** There is room for discussion about this item.

* **Valuable:** Completing the user story has to deliver value.

* **Estimable:** The Definition of Done must be clear so that the team can give each user story an estimate.

* **Small:** Each user story needs to be able to fit within a planned Sprint.

* **Testable:** A test can be conducted to check that it meets the criteria.

## Story Structure ##

```text
As a <user role>, I want <this action> so that I can <get this value>. 
```
