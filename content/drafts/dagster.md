In this article we will go through a quick start guide for Dagstaer an orchestrator designed to maintain data assets.

## Intro ##

Dagster is an orchestrator that's designed for developing and maintaining data assets, such as tables, data sets, machine learning models, and reports.

You declare functions that you want to run and the data assets that those functions produce or update. Dagster then helps you run your functions at the right time and keep your assets up-to-date.

Dagster is designed to be used at every stage of the data development life-cycle, including local development, unit tests, integration tests, staging environments, and production.

## Features ##

Dagster models pipelines in terms of the data assets they produce and consume, which, by default, brings order and observability to your data platform. Assets in Dagster can model data produced by any system, such as dbt models, Snowflake tables, or even CSV files.

Dagsterâ€™s asset-centric approach to building data pipelines makes it easy to:

* **Understand asset production**: Everyone can comprehend data lineage and asset relationships without building the pipeline themselves.
* **Verify asset currency**: Easily identify reasons for outdated assets, such as upstream data delays or code errors.
* **Diagnose data quality issues**: Implement data quality checks in pipelines and receive automatic notifications for issues.
* **Standardize best practices**: Software-defined Assets (SDAs) unify data teams, promoting collaboration and best practices like domain-specific languages and continuous integration.
* **Simplify debugging**: Debugging tools are asset-specific, allowing quick identification and resolution of issues, with minimal re-execution required

Dagster is built to be used at every stage of the data development lifecycle - local development, unit tests, integration tests, staging environments, all the way up to production.

Additionally, Dagster is accompanied by a sleek, modern, web-based UI
