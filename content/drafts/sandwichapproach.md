## Intro ##

This article summarizes the "sandwich approach" for giving negative feedback, which involves placing negative feedback between two positive remarks. While widely used, this method can undermine the feedback's effectiveness and damage relationships with direct reports. [ref](https://hbr.org/2013/04/the-sandwich-approach-undermin)

## Assumptions vs. Reality ##

Leaders assume combining positive with negative feedback makes it easier to accept, but direct reports often prefer receiving straightforward negative feedback without the "sandwich."

## Genuineness and Trust ##

The sandwich approach can make positive feedback seem insincere and lead direct reports to mistrust both positive and negative feedback.

## Balanced Feedback Fallacy ##

Leaders think the sandwich approach provides balanced feedback, but this is ineffective. Feedback should be timely and specific.

## Discomfort and Anxiety ##

Leaders may use this approach to reduce their discomfort in delivering negative feedback, but it can increase anxiety for both parties.

## Better Approach ##

A better method is to use a transparent and mutual learning approach, which involves:

* Clearly stating the purpose of the feedback.
* Describing observed concerns and asking for their perspectives.
* Engaging in a dialogue to understand the issue together and plan forward actions collaboratively.

This method respects direct reports, makes feedback feel genuine, and reduces anxiety, fostering a healthier and more effective feedback culture.
