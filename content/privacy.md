### Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics. However, we have taken all actions we can to limit the power of Google. We have configured Google Analytics to anonymize IP addresses, use SSL at all time and we have agreed a Data Processing Amendment with Google. These measures were taken from a directive of the CBP (Dutch Institute for Privacy Protection) from 2018 on how to legally use Google Analytics without explicit consent.
